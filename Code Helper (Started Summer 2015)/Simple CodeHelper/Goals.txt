Input:
make a function that takes a string and appends ".py" to the end of it and then returns it.

Questions:
"What do you want your string parameter to be called?" "theS"
"When you say "it" do you mean the String parameter? Choices: (1)y(2)n" "y"

Result: (the target code is Lua)
function (theS)
    theS = theS.."py"
    return theS

Input:
make a function that takes a string and returns it with ".py" appended to the end of it.
#not sure how to do this at this point with this particular system.

Input: (where "" encapsulates target code)
If the boy is holding "candy" then make the boy seem happy

Result: (here it seems that the computer may need to know that boy.itemsHeld is a list. This would require having tags on nouns, which would make this a lot better for an upgrade.)
if ("candy" in boy.itemsHeld):
    boy.setEmotion("happy")
    
Input:
make a class with a function that returns 0 if it gets 0, 1 if it gets something positive, and -1 if it gets something negative

Questions:
"What do you want this class to be called?" "helperClass"
"What is the name of the first function?" "getSign"
"What are the privacy modifiers of the function?" (if applicable) "none"
"Should I explicitly write public then? y/n?" "y"
"Is the first parameter type (1)(int) or (2)(double)?" "double"
"What should the parameter be called?" "num"
"Is the return value type (1)(int) or (2)(double)?" (if applicable) "int"

Result:
class helperClass {
    public getSign(double num) {
        if (num==0) {
            return 0;
        }
        else if (num>0) {
            return 1;
        }
        else if (num<0) {
            return -1;
        }
    }
}

Input:
I want a student class that has a list of test scores. The class should have one function that adds a new score to the list via human input with validation.

Questions: (I honestly don't know how to define the things it's asking me to define.)
"Please define: test, scores, score" "list of test scores:::List<double>"
"I think that each double inside the list should be considered a single score. Am I correct? y/n" "y"
"What should the list be initialized to?" "empty" "I'm sorry I don't know what that means. Did you mean 'emptiness?' y/n" "y"
"What do you want your function to be called? y/n/d (addsANew)" "addNewScore" (The d stands for the default which is what the computer thinks it should be in parentheses in the question)
"What do you want your class to be called? y/n/d (Student)" "d"
"What do you want the list of test scores to be called? y/n/d (testScores)" "d"
"Should the list of test scores be public or private? public/private" "private"
"What is the validation you would like to use?" "make sure they put in a double"
"Is the human input just a normal input function? y/n" "y"
"What would you like the prompt to be for the input?" "What score would you like to add?"

Result:
class Student {
    List<double> testScores;
    
    Student () {
        testScores = new List<double>();
    }
    
    public void addNewScore() {
        testScores.add(System.in.getNextDouble()) //#this is the basic idea of what it should do
    }
}
