Okay, so this is a place where I can type up my thoughts about the Code Helper as a whole. I'll try to date stuff as I go.

This idea came about as I began to realize two things:
1. How often I'm typing the exact same code with maybe some variable or number changes
2. How often I'm typing something into google, looking at the first couple results, using one, seeing if it works, and trying another if it doesn't.

The goal of the code helper is essentially to aid a programmer in doing these tasks.

Really, when I think of this, I think of it as being in a simple code editor, with some easy options to access it.

I just figured out a way to make it a simple code editor.
You can code it on Cloud9, and be running a Python program that will consistently look at the last version you saved and edit it.
So if you have a for(3), it will change that into for(int i = 0; i = 3; i++)
The only question then is how to train it, and how to get it to call those commands
