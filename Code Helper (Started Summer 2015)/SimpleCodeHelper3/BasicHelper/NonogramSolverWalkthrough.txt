So here is where I'm going to write out the program in a way that I think the CodeHelper should be able to kinda write it out from.
I'm going to use #USEFUL when there's something that I think the code helper would actually help speed things up.

newClass()
Name: Nonogram Solver
No init function.
It has a method called solve that takes two tables called rPuz and cPuz that represent the puzzles for the rows and the columns respectively
When it's run, it should:
Create property called board that's just an empty table (usually an object if you're not in Lua, but tables would actually work in this case too).
Set the width of the board (the property) to be the length of rPuz and the height to be the length of cPuz #USEFUL
Then, create a property called dimensions that's just a table containing the height and width of the board.


Create a board property which has two of its own properties:
width and height, which are just the length of rPuz and cPuz
Then, the board should also be an empty 2D array with dimensions equal to its own width and height. No, don't delete the width and height from it. #USEFUL

This takes so long to type... I think it would work so much better if it had text to speech. And maybe some text input for things like variable names, you know?

Another way to do this is something like this:

I want you to make a Nonogram solver:

What type of problem is a Nonogram? (Input/Output, Project Design)
I/O

Okay. What is the input?
Two tables with tables inside of them. Each of the small tables has a few numbers in them.

Okay. So it looks something like this? ({{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {10}, ...}, {{13.5, 92}, {4.5}, {-4323, 133}, ...}})
Revision: All the numbers are natural counting numbers

Okay. So it looks something like this? ({{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {10}, ...}, {{13, 92}, {4}, {4323, 133}, ...}})
Yes.

Alright! What's the output?
Do you know what a two dimensional array is?
Yes. It's something in the form {{something, something, ...}, {something, something, ...}, ...}.
Do you know what a row-major two-dimensional array is?
Yes. It's something in the form {row1, row2, ...} where each row is a table in the form {column 1, column 2, ...}.
Do you know what it means for a row-major 2 dimensional array to only contain certain numbers?
No. What does it mean for a row-major 2 dimensional array to only contain certain numbers?
Not answering right now.
Okay.
2 dimensional arrays are arrays.
I knew that already, but thanks for the reminder.
Do you know what it means for an array to only contain certain numbers?
No. What does it mean for an array to only contain certain numbers?
Not going to answer right now.
Okay.
Do you know what certain numbers means?
Yes. Certain numbers is a placeholder for some collection of numbers that can be specified later on.
If an array only contains certain numbers, that means that each number in the array is one of the certain numbers.
I didn't understand that. I think I was confused by "one of the certain numbers"
Do you know what it means for a number to be one of the certain numbers?
No. What does it mean for a number to be one of the certain numbers?
It means that once certain numbers are specified, the number is in the collection of certain numbers.

Just to make sure I have this right: The input is a specific collection of numbers, called "certain numbers" and a number.
The number is one of the certain numbers
#agh... this is way too complicated! I can't even figure out how in the world you would teach this thing stuff

The output is a row-major 2 dimensional array containing only the numbers 1 and 0
