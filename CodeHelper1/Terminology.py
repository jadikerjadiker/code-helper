'''
Straight code (<il2>stuff</>): the highest level of code. This is what the user generally inputs into the program.
Metacode (<il1>stuff</>): A language meant to make it easier to tell the computer what to do in more computerized terms. Straight code "compiles" into metacode and base code.
Base code (<il0>stuff</>): the actual language that the Code Helper is written in (in this case, Python). This is the code the computer knows how to straight-up run.
Target code: What should hopefully be the output of the program. You put in English (straight code) and get back JavaScript (target code).
