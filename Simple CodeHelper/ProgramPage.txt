Okay, so I think I want to have different pages for different projects instead of combining them all into one under different sections.
This is especially because sections don't work too well right now.
I just realized how annoying it is to have to write this here, so I'm going to make a "start format" line necessary.

Just did that and tested it. So now I can start typing at the top.
