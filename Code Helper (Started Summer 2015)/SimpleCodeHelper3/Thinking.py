Okay, so it's looking like either the idea is more complicated than I thought it would be, or it's less powerful than I thought it would be.

The basic idea: computers know how to do calculations inherently. You give them a programming language and a function and they "know" how to do stuff.

So I should be able to write a program that will allow me to "teach" the computer how to do stuff.

I list commands, and if it doesn't recognize a command, it asks me to define it.

Let me look at the version I made that worked with for loops to see why in the world this ended up being so complicated.

I can't find it, so I'm going to reprogram it. Hopefully by now I've become slightly better at programming and it won't seem so complicated.
