I want to make a program that will st do something.

I wish there were more games online that allowed me to program them.

I also wish I could easily make a game where I could code players that would play against each other.

What if I made a virtual card game, where instead of actually playing the game, you programmed a computer to play for you?

What if I made a simple game of war? Card games are notoriously easy... BS? War?

I think war will be easier. I'll try to come up with a computer that can play fairly well.

Aces are high.
