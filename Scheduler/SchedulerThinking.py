Okay, so the main idea with this is that I want to have todos that can be scheduled on an actual calendar

The advantage is that this program will tell me how much time I have scheduled for something and I can keep track of my time more easily.

Commands that I want to be able to work in the first version of the program:

Add to todos
Delete todos
Edit todos

So some of the things I want to do are going to be harder than I thought to do, such as editing todos.

But I do think it's feasible, and would aid my productivity. Summer project perhaps?
